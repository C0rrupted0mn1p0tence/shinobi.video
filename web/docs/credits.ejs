        <p>This page is a dedication to those that I believe contributed greatly to the platform. It would be unacceptable to disregard their contributions to Shinobi.</p>
<p>The people mentioned on this page, I have no clue whether or not they identify themselves as <i>Shinobi Devs</i>.. but <i>they are awesome Shinobi Devs</i>. Without them Shinobi would not be what it is now and what it will hopefully become.</p>
<p>Thank You from Moe Alam.</p>

<p><b>ZoneMinder</b>. You get a special place in my heart. With you I learned PHP and JavaScript. You were a major reason why I opened documentation on programming languages for many years. As much as there are critical statements about zoneminder, there is praise that can’t be found in words. For without you there may be no Shinobi.</p>
<p>” <i>Is there someone precious to you? Someone who makes you strong? truly strong?” -Haku</i></p>
<p><b>My brothers, mother and father.</b> Without them I would have no time or shelter with the level of comfort that I do. They are the reason I exist and thrive. They are my life force. They are precious to me. <b>My family.</b></p>
