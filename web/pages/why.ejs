                    <p>
                        I wanted to make a world class CCTV platform. One that anyone could use. Simply login to your account, add camera details, set options, and away you go. No client app installations. Viewing streams and recordings on your mobile device by simply opening a web page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means you could view it on any device with a capable web browser. A base was needed to start with so I took to the internet for more answers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A popular CCTV application born in 2003 was the primary choice but found it wasn't capable of fufilling the role.
